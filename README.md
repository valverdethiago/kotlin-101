# Kotlin 101 ðŸš€

This repository serves as my personal journey in learning Kotlin programming language. It contains various examples, exercises, and projects that demonstrate different aspects of Kotlin development.

## About Kotlin

Kotlin is a modern, cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language developed by JetBrains. It's designed to be fully interoperable with Java and the JVM while offering more concise syntax and additional features.

Key features of Kotlin include:
- Null safety
- Coroutines for asynchronous programming
- Extension functions
- Smart casts
- Data classes
- Higher-order functions
- Full Java interoperability

## Project Structure

This repository will be organized to cover various Kotlin concepts and features:
